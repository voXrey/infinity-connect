## User Guide

### 1. RULES
* Decide who plays first. Players will alternate turns after playing a checker. *NOTE: The player starting the game will play second in the next game.* 
* On a player turn, drop one of your checkers down **ANY** of the slots in the top of the grid. 
* Player alternates until one player gets **FIVE** checkers of his or her colour in a row. The five in a row can be **horizontal**, **vertical**, or **diagonal** (see [attachments](#attachments)). 
### 2. HOW TO PLAY

When your turn arrives, you have several options, you need to enter the terminal: 

- `p[column]` to **PLAY** a checker in the column. 
- `f[column]<:[row]>` to **FOCUS** your view on a part of the grid (the column and row correspond to the checker at the bottom middle). 

*NOTE: row is set to 0 by default.* 

- `s` to **SAVE** the game. Enter a **free** file name. 
- `q` to **QUIT** the game. 

*NOTE: [parameter] means required parameter and <element> means optional element.*  

### 3. MENUS

To navigate through the menus, simply enter the number of your choice. 

When you want to load a game from the main menu, you will need to give the **exact name** (including the extension) of the corresponding file. If you wish to load a game that is not from our game program, please **respect the format** in the [attachments.](#attachments) 

In the ‚Äúothers‚Äù submenu, you can access the ‚Äúsettings‚Äù submenu. Here you can see the current settings (‚Äúshow settings‚Äù), load a settings file (‚Äúload settings‚Äù), or create a default settings file that will be loaded (‚Äúreset settings‚Äù). Please **respect the format** in the [attachments.](#attachments) 

*Note: File manipulation works as it does for the game saves.*
